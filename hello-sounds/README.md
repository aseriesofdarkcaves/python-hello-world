# hello-sounds

Audio files sourced from https://www.pacdv.com/sounds/index.html.

I can't include the required `wav` files for licencing reasons, but to get this to work, just download the first four
sounds here: https://www.pacdv.com/sounds/fart-sounds.html and place them into the same directory as the `fart.py`
module.
